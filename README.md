The WiDS Datathon 2024 focuses on a prediction task using a roughly 18k record dataset (split into training and test sets) representing patients and their characteristics (age, race, BMI, zip code), their diagnosis and treatment information (breast cancer diagnosis code, metastatic cancer diagnosis code, metastatic cancer treatments, … etc.), their geo (zip-code level) demographic data (income, education, rent, race, poverty, …etc), as well as toxic air quality data (Ozone, PM25 and NO2) that tie health outcomes to environmental conditions. Each row in the data corresponds a single patient and her Diagnosis Period. Your task is to assess whether the likelihood of the patient’s Diagnosis Period being less than 90 days is predictable using these characteristics and information about the patient.
